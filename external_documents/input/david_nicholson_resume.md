Professional Experience
----------
**Data Scientist**  
**Digital Science & Research Solutions, Ltd.**  
**June 2022 - Present**

- Uses textual analysis to help government funders and clients understand research trends and emerging topics
- Worked with machine learning models to perform topical analysis on research grants, publications, etc.
- Used Dash to build dashboards that narrate results for government funding clients

**Graduate Researcher Scientist**  
**University of Pennsylvania**  
**August 2016 - June 2022**

- Designed and implemented parallel processing pipelines that achieved a 3x speed-up when analyzing terabytes of biomedical text.
- Used weak supervision for a 1.5x speed-up when training deep learning models (recurrent neural networks and transformers) to extract biomedical relationships from biomedical text.
- Applied a k-nearest-neighbor model to provide scientists with a web service that identifies a listing of journals linguistically similar to a preprint of interest.
- Applied a time series analysis to discover over 20,000 different timepoints where words have changed their semantic meaning.
