Summary
-------
Data Scientist with 15+ years of programming experience and 6+ years of experience in data analytics and visualization. My data analytics experience consisted of using document embeddings to gain further insight into biomedical research. Recently, my experience has grown to include working with large language models, clustering, and other analytics to help government clients better understand biomedical research.

Professional Experience
----------
**Data Scientist**  
**Digital Science & Research Solutions, Ltd.**  
June 2022 - Present  

- Constructed a software package to enable fast clustering of document sets, cluster hierarchy generation, and cluster metadata (labels from LLMs, various metrics such as Growth Rate, etc.).
- Maintained an ETL pipeline design to extract and update over 100GB of document data for the National Institute of Health (NIH) clientele.
- Designed and implemented a data analysis pipeline designed to cluster an 818k+ document set centered on women’s health for a client affiliated with the National Institute of Health (NIH).
- Constructed an ETL pipeline designed to detect cancer drug treatments using a 64k+ biomedical document set for a pharmaceutical client.
- Back-tested vector databases were used to determine which database is most optimal for handling 10M+ document embedding vectors.
- Constructed a pipeline that used deep learning and dimensionality reduction models to uncover research topics and trends within a 20M+ document set for government clients.


**Graduate Researcher Scientist**  
**University of Pennsylvania**  
August 2016 - June 2022  

- Designed and implemented parallel processing pipelines that achieved a 3x speed-up when analyzing terabytes of biomedical text.
- Used weak supervision for a 1.5x speed-up when training deep learning models (recurrent neural networks and transformers) to extract biomedical relationships from biomedical text.
- Applied a k-nearest-neighbor model to provide scientists with a web service that lists journals linguistically similar to a preprint of interest.
- Applied a time series analysis to discover over 20,000 different time points where words have changed their semantic meaning.
